Applying Machine Learning algorithms to detect whether projects end up successfully or not

Kickstarter is a crowd funding platform. The data used here is collected in Kaggle. It contains a bunch of data about the project ranging from when it was offered to the public, when the platform stopped this project, how much was the goal fund, how much was collected to how many backers were there and where the projects was intended to run.
